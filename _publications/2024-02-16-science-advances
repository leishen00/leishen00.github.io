This study proposed a spatially multidimensional and multicohort comparative proteomics research strategy for the mechanistic exploration of glioma. We demonstrated the potential of this approach to specifically discover the glioma-associated proteins and their different patterns in genesis, migration, and exchange in the blood of patients with glioma. Our data offer a landscape view of the molecular changes induced by glioma, which may provide useful diagnostic and therapeutic clues in the ongoing battle against this deadly disease. This innovative research strategy is also promising for application to mechanistic studies of other tumors.
